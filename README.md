*Iron Dome*

I have written many articles about the Iron Dome, a Jewish creation in the past, and I will show you a little more about the mathematical side of this, describing its functionality again ...

Iron Dome has three main parts...

1.) Radar System
2.) Impact Point finder(Control system)
3.) Launcher



Ok Now
In this Iron Dome System
There are five main steps

1.) Enemy Rockets Fired üî• 

2.) Radar System Detects Rocket and Tracks

3.) Control System  estimates the impact point

4.) Luancher Fires missile to intercept

5.)Missile Explodes near rocket, destroying it

*_Radar System_*

In this Radar System launched rocket can be identified by Radar...
In the Radar Semi-sphere ,If a Rocket is found Then Using Dopler's Effect We can Calculate the Velocity of the Rocket

_Calculation:-_

If V is the velocity Compenent of the Rocket towards the Launcher is V at the place when the Radar hits it...

Then,
If the Velocity of light is C...

And the Absolute Frequenzy of the  Radar is f...

Then Using Dopler's Effect...

C/f = (C+V)/ f'

f' = (C+V)f /C

Then if the frequenzy that is Observed by the Launcher again is f" ...

(C-V) / f' = C / f"

f" = C f' /(C-V)

f" = (C+V) f /(C-V)

Then the Difference of the frequenzy observed by the Launcher is df...

df =  2Vf/ (C-V) ~  2Vf/C
[ C>>>>V]

Using a frequenzy divider Circuit
(There is a simple  image of the Circuit with a flip flop with a feedback...Then We can  calculate the Velocity as Frequenzy )
And Further More,
We can get more data with this part
Then We can find the direcion of the Velocity of the Rocket. 

*_Impact Point Finder(Control System)_*

If this Rocket is destroyed on a constant height from the Ground,
Then all the people are safe...

Then the most important thing is calculating the time when this rocket comes to the constant height For That,
There is an Algorithm with Differentation and Intergation Circuits...

This Control System is made for more than 10000 Algorithms of Projectiles...

For Simple Example...

X = 6t + 8

Y = 5 t^2 + 7t + 1

z = 8t + 9

dX/dt = 6
dY/dt =10 t +7
dZ/dt = 8


again We put to the Differentator...

d^2 X / dt^2 = 0
d^2 Y / dt^2 = 10
d^2 Z/ dt^2 = 0

Then there is a Differentation Circuit ( IC 741 feedback with a Resistor and a Capacitior :- I give the Article About IC with this) inside the Control System...
Then These Function are Differenated automatically...
Then the Control Unit Identify the Accelearation and the Velocity and the time of the Rocket when it comes to the constant Height...
(Then It can identify the Point)

_Now There is making a new Projectile for the Missile to Impact  the Rocket..._

*_Launcher_*

Now Launcher begin to change its projecting direction and the Velocity using a Robotic method...
(Further More in University High levels ) 

Then the Rocket will be destroyed by the missile...


The Area covered by the Iron Dome is known as  Iron Dome Shield...
